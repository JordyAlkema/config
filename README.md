## Config Files

Each folder corresponds to a given application's configuration files except for:

* `arch`
    * scripts used to install and configure Arch Linux
* `dotfiles`
    * various dotfiles (duh) that go in the home directory
* `old_configs`
    * old config files that I no longer use
* `peripherals`
    * files to configure the mouse and keyboard

And in case you are unfamiliar with some of these applications:

* highlight
    * used by ranger to syntax highlight previewed files

Any additions or suggestions are welcome!
