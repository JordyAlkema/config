## Config files

Each folder corresponds to a given application's configuration files except for:

* `arch`
    * includes scripts that I use to install Arch Linux along with apps and settings that I use
* `dotfiles`
    * includes various dotfiles (duh) that go in the home directory
* `old_configs`
    * includes old configuration files that are no longer used
* `peripherals`
    * includes files to configure the mouse and keyboard

And in case you are unfamiliar with some of these applications:

* highlight
    * used by ranger to syntax highlight files being previewed

Any additions or suggestions are welcome!
