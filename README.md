## Config files

Each folder corresponds to a given application's configuration files except for:

* dotfiles
    * includes various dotfiles (duh) that go in the home directory
* old_configs
    * includes old configuration files that are no longer used
* peripherals
    * includes files to configure the mouse and keyboard

In addition, the arch folder includes scripts to install Arch Linux

And in case you are unfamiliar, devilspie is an application that provides per application transparency that I use for termite because it's better than termite's built in transparency

Any additions or suggestions are welcome!
